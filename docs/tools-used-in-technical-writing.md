# Tools Used in Technical Writing
Technical writers use several tools to create, edit, manage, and share documentation. Below are some crucial tools:
1. **GitHub**
- GitHub is crucial for managing documentation, collaborating with developers, and ensuring version control of documents. It enables you to track changes, maintain different versions, and also integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
2. **Confluence**
- Confluence is a collaboration tool to create, organize, and share documentation. It helps to build internal wikis, knowledge bases, and FAQs. Technical writers can collaborate with teams and create structured documentation.
3. **Markdown**
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language which is used for writing formatted document. It can easily be converted into HTML which makes it perfect for creating web-based content like README files, tutorials, and documentation.
4. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- VS Code is a powerful and lightweight code editor, but for technical writers, it’s a great platform for writing documentation. It supports syntax highlighting for Markdown, and has extensions that help in providing live previews, spell check, and collaboration tools.
5. **Jira**
- Jira is used to plan, track, and manage documentation tasks within the agile software development lifecycle. It generally integrated with a dedicated content management system (CMS) such as Atlassian's Confluence.
